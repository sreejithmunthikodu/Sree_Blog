Levels of measurements of variable
Once the cases and variables are identified, it is important to choose levels of measurements for the variables. The levels of measurement of variables influence what statistical analysis is appropriate for the given data. The different levels of measurements of variables are summarized below.

1.     The nominal level of measurement
A nominal variable is made up of various categories that differ from each other. However, there is no order among the various categories. In our dataset, language is a nominal variable. The various languages such as English, French, and Punjabi are the categories. Although there are differences between the categories, there is no order exists.

2.     Ordinal level of measurement
An ordinal variable is made up of various categories that differ from each other and there is an order in these categories. However, the order has no interval. We cannot add or subtract these categories. In our dataset, precipitation is an ordinal variable. The three categories: low, moderate and high, have a meaningful order. But we don’t have information about the differences between these categories.

3.     Interval level of measurement
Interval level of measurement is suitable when the variable is made up of various categories that differ from each other, there is an order in these categories and there are similar intervals between different categories that enable addition and subtraction. However, the variable has no meaningful zero points at which we can say the variable doesn’t exist at all. This makes it impossible to perform multiplication or division on these variables. For example, the temperature in our dataset has similar intervals between values. Difference between 10 degree Celsius and 11 degree Celsius is the same as the difference between 25 degree Celsius and 26 degree Celsius. Also, 0 degree Celsius doesn’t mean that there is no temperature. So we can add or subtract the values but not multiply or divide. We cannot say 20 degree Celsius is twice as large as 10 degree Celsius.

4.     Ratio level of measurement
Ratio level of measurement is used when the variable is made up of various categories that differ from each other, there is an order among these categories, there are similar intervals between categories and there is a meaningful zero point where we can say the variable doesn’t exist at all. Hence operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on these variables. For example, the income in our dataset is a ratio variable. When the income takes a value zero, that means there is no income at all. Thus we can multiply and divide these values and say an income of 50,000 is twice as large as an income of 25,000.
